# Odin-recipes
A set of a few nice receipts made to train basic html skills. 
Create 5 static pages and fill them in with receipts using html nodes described in Odin project tutorial.
Not much there: Html, head-body, meta, hX, p, ul/ol/li
Publish them here so of course some git+github practice.

Not sure i need all of this but its a nice step to be in tune with lessons. Sort of a test of resolve.
