        <li>1 Eye of Round, Sirloin Tip or Top Sirloin Beef Roast (about 2 lb/1 kg)</li>
        <li>1 pkg (142 g) baby spinach, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 orange or yellow sweet pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pinenuts or slivered almonds, toasted</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 slices prosciutto</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded smoked Cheddar, mozzarella or provolone</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp EACH salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a large chef’s knife or carving knife, slice roast lengthwise, stopping when you are about ½ inch (1 cm) from bottom of the roast. Open the roast up like a book and cut one side to “unroll” the roast to be about ¾ inch (2 cm) thick piece of meat.</li>
        <li>Do the same with the other side so that you end up with a rectangular piece of meat that is about ¾ inch (2 cm) thick.</li>
        <li>Using a flat meat mallet, pound the roast to about ½ inch (1 cm) thickness; set aside.</li>
        <li> In a large skillet over medium high heat, cook spinach until wilted. Drain any water. Add oil and return to medium heat. Add garlic, pepper and parsley; cook, stirring for about 5 minutes or until pepper is softened. Re-move from heat; stir in Parmesan, pine nuts and green onions; set aside.</li>
        <li>Lay prosciutto evenly over roast and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Spread spinach mixture evenly over top.</li>
        <li>Roll up jelly roll style and tie with kitchen string at 2 inch (5 cm) intervals. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place roast on rack in shallow pan or lined baking tray; oven-sear in preheated 450˚F (230˚C) oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 275˚F (140˚C) and cook for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until meat thermometer reaches 135˚F (57˚C). Remove from oven; cover loosely and let stand 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
