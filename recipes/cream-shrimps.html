    <div>Creamy Garlic Shrimp With Parmesan is a deliciously easy Shrimp Recipe! Coated in a rustic and buttery sauce ready in less than 10 minutes!</div>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound (500 grams) shrimp, tails on or off</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine* or chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups reduced fat cream**</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, until just cooked through and pink. Transfer to a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the same skillet. Sauté garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Pour in the white wine or broth; allow to reduce to half while scraping any bits off of the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low-medium heat, add the cream and bring to a gentle simmer, while stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.</li>
        <li>Add the parmesan cheese and allow sauce to gently simmer for a further minute or so until the cheese melts and sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp back into the pan, sprinkle with parsley. Taste test sauce and adjust salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve over pasta, rice or steamed veg.</li>
    </ol>
